# Speech-Recognition-System

This project allows you to make a Speech Recognition System using Python. Converting spoken words into text becomes easy with the use of the handful of packages mentioned bellow. I also added some features to the code such as playing songs on Youtube, showing the current date, and performing a Wikipedia Search by vocal commands.


Installation:
Open the terminal and type:

- /pip install pyttsx3/i : pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. It converts easily an entered text into speech.

- pip install PyAudio: In case It doesn't work, lower down your Python version to Python 3

- pip install pywhatkit: This module offers many libraries that allow sending WhatsApp messages at a specific time, perform a Google Search, etc. In this project, we will use it to play Youtube videos.

- pip install wikipedia: This module is used to fetch a variety of information from the Wikipedia website
